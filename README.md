# Pseudotime Analysis of Embryonic Mouse Islets
Pseudotime Analysis of embryonic mouse islets to uncover the role of Nnat in establishing mature beta cell populations.

This analysis was done for the study titled: *Establishment of beta cell heterogeneity via differential CpG methylation at Nnat*

This analysis depends on the [Seurat v4.3](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) and [Monocle 3](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/) packages in R.

The datasets used were acquired from the following studies:
- Embryonic islets: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06176-3
- Adult islets: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212877822001648?via%3Dihub
